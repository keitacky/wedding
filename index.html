                            <p>Our first trip to California and our first plane ride together. The first place I wanted to go was the beach. It was so peaceful to sit and watch the ocean with Kei. I even saw a dolphin jump out of the water. This is one of my favorite photos of us.</p>

                            <p>Here is us again in Taiwan. We both wrote our wishes on a red ballon lantern. Kei refused to tell me what he wrote. Months later a friend told me it translates to "forever love". My wish was to learn Japanese. I do not speak Japanese. But if only one wish can come true his is much better.</p>

The next day we stayed the night at a beautiful resort where he proposed to me by a campfire. The weather was perfect and so was the moment.</p>

I spent the week before learning how to walk in 5 in. heels for my outfit and ended up biting off more than I could chew. Kei gave me his arm for support and made sure I was steady on my feet.</p>
